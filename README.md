# RaspberryPiMOTD
This is just a trashy little MOTD script I made for the raspberry pi

This script runs assuming you 

1. Move the script into `/usr/local/bin/`
2. Run `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/motd_script.py`
3. Open `~/.profile`
    - Add `motd_script.py` at the very bottom
    - Save and exit the file
